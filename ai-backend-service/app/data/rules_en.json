The goal is to collect the most victory points by constructing districts, using character roles wisely, and playing tactically. The game ends when a player builds their eighth district, at which point that round is completed. Points are earned by: the value of constructed districts, bonus points for the first completed city (4 points) or other completed cities (2 points), collecting all five different types of districts (3 points), and by the special abilities of unique districts. In case of a tie, the player who was last the King wins."

Turn Phase: Characters are called in numerical order (1-8). When your character is called and you are not assassinated, you take your turn.

Collect all colors for bonus points. 4. Timing: Use character abilities at the right moment. Build important districts when the Warlord is unlikely. 5. Attack and Defense: Use the Assassin and Thief against strong players. Choose the Bishop for protection. 6. Resources: Balance between taking gold and drawing cards. Use unique district abilities for extra advantages. 7. Endgame: Work towards a complete city (8 districts). Consider speeding up the end when strong opponents are close. Calculate possible final scores, including bonuses."
